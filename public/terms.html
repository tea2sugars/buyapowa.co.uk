            <a name="infous">1. Information about us</a>
             <p>BuyaPowa.com (the "site") is a website operated by Buyapowa Limited ("we").  We are registered in England and Wales under company number 7574698 with our registered office at BuyaPowa.com, 24 Greville Street, Farringdon, London, EC1N 8SS. Our VAT Number is GB116526723.</p>

            <a name="prod">2. How these terms apply to the sale of products</a>
            <p>2.1 These Terms and Conditions of Sale (together with any relevant documents referred to in them (including the Website <a href=" http://www.buyapowa.com/termsofuse">Terms of Use</a> and <a href=" http://www.buyapowa.com/privacypolicy">Privacy Policy</a>) set out the terms on which we supply any product (a "Product") via our site to you.</p>
            <p>2.2 Each time you purchase Products through this site you will be required to click the "I Agree" button to complete the order. By clicking the "I Agree" button and/or by using this site to purchase Products you are accepting these terms and conditions of sale and if relevant any product specific terms. Any terms which you seek to impose in respect of your purchase of Products through this site will not form part of any contract between us. Please read these terms and conditions carefully before ordering any of the Products from our site. If you have any queries on these terms please contact us before placing any order.</p>
            <p>2.3 From time to time, product specific terms may apply in addition to or replace these terms in respect of certain products available on the site. For example, additional terms such as territorial restrictions may apply to certain products. These product specific terms will be clearly indicated and featured on the site in the order process for the relevant Product.</p>
            <p>2.4 From time to time, if a Co-buy sells out, we may also reward the winner of the Co-buy leader board (i.e. the person who brings the most Co-buyers to the relevant Co-buy) with the applicable free product or service for which they are bidding.  [If two or more people are at the top of the leader board because they have brought in the same number of Co-buyers into the Co-buy, then the first person who first placed a bid on that Co-buy will appear at the top of the leader board, and may qualify for the free product of service].  This benefit will only apply when clearly advertised in the relevant Co-buy and we reserve the right not to offer free products or services at our discretion.</p>
            <p>2.5 To the extent that there is any conflict or inconsistency between any of the terms and conditions on this site and the Privacy Policy in respect of your use of and/or order for Products the following order of precedence will apply:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Product specific terms;</li>
                  <li>Product Terms and Conditions of Sale;</li>
                  <li>Website Terms of Use; and</li>
                  <li>Privacy Policy;</li>
              </ul>
            <p>2.6 We recommend you review these terms and conditions each time you purchase Products and print a copy of these terms and conditions for your future reference.</p>

            <p>3.3 Any credit card/debit card billing address must be in the United Kingdom.  By placing an order for Products you agree that we may store, process and use personal data collected from you for the purposes of processing your order and fulfilling the Contract and otherwise in accordance with our <a href=" http://www.buyapowa.com/privacypolicy">Privacy Policy</a>.

            <a name="placingorder">6. Placing an order and how the contract is formed between you and us</a>
            <p>6.1 The site works by using a process we call "Co-buying". Co-buying is when a number of people place an order for a particular Product at the same time and this may mean that the price of the Product is driven down  - the more people who place an order for the Product, the lower the price falls.  Each Co-buy has a limited time period (sometimes of no more than a few hours) - when the time period expires and the Co-buy closes, the price for the Product is set.</p>
            <p>6.2 Each Product is made available to order at a certain, current price (the "Current Price") which will be clear on the site at all times. You can place an order for the Product at the Current Price.  The price for the Product may remain at the Current Price, and if the Co-buy closes at the Current Price then your order will be to purchase the Product at the Current Price.</p>
            <p>6.3 The price of the Product may drop below the Current Price if more users choose to order the Product - the price will fall in stages which can be seen on the site at all times during the relevant Co-buy.  Regardless of the Current Price at the time that you placed your order, the price of your order will be the price for the Product which is displayed at the time that the Co-buy closes - even though the price may have fallen from the price that you had earlier agreed to pay.  When the Co-buy closes, we will send you an email to confirm the price that the Co-buy closed at.</p>
            <p>6.4 After placing your order for a Product, you will receive an e-mail from us setting out the details of your order and acknowledging that we have received your order. Please note that this does not mean that your order has been accepted. You must check that the details on this e-mail are correct as soon as possible as your order represents an offer to us to buy a Product. We recommend you print out and keep a copy of that e-mail.</p>
            <p>6.5 You agree to provide us with truthful, complete and accurate details. You agree to provide us with your details only. You should keep any account details (including any password) safe and should not share or disclose them to anyone. Please notify us immediately if you suspect your account details have been compromised. You are responsible for all orders placed/activity undertaken using your account details.</p>
            <p>6.6 The contract for the purchase of any Product will be between you and us and will only be formed when we send you the Dispatch Confirmation and we have received payment in full for the Product (the "Contract"). Until we send you the Dispatch Confirmation and receive payment in full there is no contract between you and us for the Products. Until this time, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to reject any order we receive.</p>
            <p>6.7 The Contract will relate only to those Products whose dispatch we have confirmed in the Dispatch Confirmation and for which we have received payment in full. We will not be obliged to supply any other Products which may have been part of your order until the dispatch of such Products has been confirmed in a separate Dispatch Confirmation.</p>
            <div class="back-to-top"><a href="termsandconditions#top">Back to top</a></div>

            <a name="availability">7. Availability and delivery</a>
            <p>7.1 All Products featured on our site are subject to availability. We will endeavour to make it clear where Products offered are available for a limited time or in limited numbers. We update our site regularly to avoid causing disappointment but it can take time to update our site and we cannot guarantee that any particular goods will be in stock at a particular time.</p>
            <p>7.2 We will endeavour to fulfil your order as soon as reasonably possible in accordance with the delivery guidelines that we provide from time to time. Note however that all delivery times which we quote are estimates only, based on availability, order processing and arrangements with delivery companies. We will fulfil your order within 30 days of the date of the Dispatch Confirmation, unless there are exceptional circumstances. We will use reasonable endeavours to keep you informed by email if any of the Products which you have ordered are unavailable or there are delays with ordering/dispatching them.</p>
            <p>7.3 Unless otherwise specified in the Dispatch Confirmation, Products will be sent by standard post and are not capable of being tracked. If you have selected a trackable delivery option, your tracking number will be included in the Dispatch Confirmation.</p>
            <div class="back-to-top"><a href="termsandconditions#top">Back to top</a></div>


            <a name="priceandpayment">8. Price and payment</a>
            <p>8.1 Subject to sections 8.2, 8.3, 8.5 and 21.2 the price of any Product will be as quoted on our site at the close of the applicable Co-buy, except in the case of obvious error.</p>
            <p>8.2 We use our best efforts to ensure the prices of Products displayed on our site are correct. However, our site contains a number of Products and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the Products listed on our site may be incorrectly priced. We will normally verify prices as part of our dispatch procedures so that, where a Product's correct price is less than our stated price, we may at our discretion charge the lower amount when dispatching the Product to you. If a Product's correct price is higher than the price stated on our site at the time you placed your order, we will normally, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before dispatching the Product (ie to confirm your order and that you wish to proceed at the correct price), or reject your order and notify you of such rejection.</p>
            <p>8.3 We are under no obligation to provide the Product to you at the incorrect (lower) price, even after we have sent you a Dispatch Confirmation, if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could have reasonably been recognised by you as a pricing mistake. We reserve the right to withdraw from the contract including any accepted Contract in the case of obvious pricing errors.</p>
            <p>8.4 The prices on the site include VAT but exclude delivery costs, which will be added to the total amount due.  Delivery costs are set out at the time that you place your order.</p>
            <p>8.5 Payment for all Products must be by credit or debit card or via Paypal. We accept the credit and debit cards displayed on the payment page of our Site from time to time. No other methods of payment will be accepted. We will not charge your credit or debit card until the Contract is concluded.</p>
            <p>8.6 By providing the details of a credit or debit card to be billed or payment account to be debited for payment of the price due, you confirm that you are authorised to purchase the Products and that you are the holder of the relevant credit or debit card or of the relevant payment account or are expressly authorised to use such.</p>
            <p>8.7 All credit/debit card holders are subject to validation checks and authorisation by the card issuer. If the issuer of your card refuses to authorise payment we will not accept your order and we will not be liable for any delay or non-delivery and we are not obliged to inform you of the reason for the refusal. We are not responsible for your card issuer or bank charging you as a result of our processing of your credit/debit card payment in accordance with your order. Should there be a problem with your payment we will contact you to discuss the next steps.</p>
            <div class="back-to-top"><a href="termsandconditions#top">Back to top</a></div>

            <a name="risktitle">9. Risk and title</a>
            <p>9.1 We will retain ownership of the Product, which will only pass to you when we receive full payment of all sums due in respect of the Product, including delivery charges.</p>
            <div class="back-to-top"><a href="termsandconditions#top">Back to top</a></div>

            <a name="rightsandreturns">10.	Your rights and returns</a>
            <p>10.1 Non-receipt of Product: if you do not receive Products ordered by you within one month of the date on which they were dispatched to you, please contact us at <a href="mailto:help@buyapowa.com">help@buyapowa.com</a>.</p>
            <p>10.2 Incorrect/Faulty/Defective Goods: we take great care in the dispatch and packaging of our items. In the unlikely event of faults with, or damage to, the Products or if you have received an incorrect Product please contact us at <a href="mailto:help@buyapowa.com">help@buyapowa.com</a>.  If you notify us that you have received an incorrect or faulty Product, we will collect the Product or ask you to return the Product to us at our expense and once, acting reasonably, we have examined the Product and confirmed it is an incorrect or faulty Product, we will (at our option) replace the Product or provide you with a refund.</p>
            <p>10.3 General Right to Return: in addition to the right to return above, whilst we hope you are delighted with your purchase, if you are contracting as a consumer (ie not purchasing goods on behalf of a business) and are based in the European Union, you can choose to cancel a Contract at any time within seven working days, beginning on the day after you received the Products.  You must cancel the Contract and then return the applicable Product to us in accordance with clause 10.4 below. In this case, you will receive a full refund of the price paid for the Products.</p>
            <p>10.4 To cancel a Contract under clause 10.4, you must inform us in writing at BuyaPowa.com, 24 Greville Street, Farringdon, London, EC1N 8SS or via email to help@buyapowa.com.  If we receive confirmation that you wish to cancel the order before dispatch of the Product we will refund your payment in accordance with clause 11.1.1 and will not dispatch the Product. If you have received the Product and/or it has been dispatched you must return the Product(s) to us immediately at BuyaPowa.com, 24 Greville Street, Farringdon, London, EC1N 8SS in the same condition in which you received them, and at your own cost and risk. You have a legal obligation to take reasonable care of the Products while they are in your possession and we reserve the right to seek compensation from you for any failure to comply with this obligation.</p>
            <p>10.5 You will not have any right to cancel a contract for the Products under clause 10.4 if:</p>
             <p>10.5.1 you have unsealed the packaging of audio or video recordings or any software;</p>
             <p>10.5.2 the Product has been personalised for you or made to your specification; and/or</p>
             <p>10.5.3 the Products are periodicals or magazines.</p>
             <p>10.6 Return Packaging: if you are returning a Product it would be helpful if you would use the original packaging and outer cardboard when doing so. If you no longer have this packaging please include the name of the person who ordered the Product and the order number in the return package. Note that if you have opened/unsealed the Product you will lose your right to return it in certain circumstances (see clause 10.5 for further details).</p>
             <p>10.7 Return Address: the return address is BuyaPowa.com, 24 Greville Street, Farringdon, London, EC1N 8SS.</p>
             <p>10.8 If you would like more information on your rights as a consumer, please contact your local citizens advice bureau or trading standards office.</p>

            <a name="refund">11. Our refunds policy</a>
            <p>11.1</p>
            <p>11.1 When you return a Product to us:</p>
            <p>11.1.1 because you have cancelled the Contract between us within the seven-day cooling-off period (see clause 10.4 above), we will process the refund due to you as soon as reasonably possible and, in any case, within 30 days of the day you have given notice of your cancellation. In this case, we will refund the price of the Product in full, including the cost of sending the item to you. However, you will be responsible for the cost of returning the Product to us;</p>
            <p>11.1.2 because you claim that the Product is faulty, we will examine the returned Product and (where we decide to provide you with a refund rather than a replacement in accordance with clause 10.2 above) we will notify you of such refund via e-mail within a reasonable period of time. We will usually process the refund due to you as soon as reasonably possible and, in any case, within 30 days of the day we confirmed to you via e-mail that you were entitled to a refund for the Product.</p>
            <p>11.2 We will only refund any money received from you using the same method originally used by you to pay for the Product.</p>
